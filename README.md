# 1213_BookStore

This is a Java application that mimics a Bookstore. The main idea behind this activity is to create a system that allows a bookstore owner keep track of their inventory and and members. The application keeps track of the store's inventory, sells memberships, records and stores memberships, and completed transactions. 

The stores sells three types of products: books, CDs, and DVDs.
The store offers two types of memberships to customers: regular memberships and premium memberships. The regular membership is free, while the premium members pay a fee every month.
The store keeps track of payment method for their premium members and whether the monthly fee is paid on time.
The system should keep track of the members and how much money each has spent at the store regardless if they are regular or premium members.
The system also keeps track of the inventory of each product.
